# Product Requirements Document: User Authentication & Profile System

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD outlines the implementation of a comprehensive user authentication and profile system for a Letterboxd-inspired gaming platform. The system will enable users to create accounts, build detailed gaming profiles, and interact with the platform's core features. The solution will leverage Supabase for authentication, database storage, and real-time capabilities, providing a seamless user experience similar to Letterboxd's user-centric approach.

## Goals

1. **User Onboarding**: Enable smooth user registration and profile creation with optional profile completion
2. **Profile Management**: Allow users to create comprehensive gaming profiles with preferences, history, and social features
3. **Authentication Security**: Implement secure authentication using email/password and social login options
4. **Platform Integration**: Seamlessly integrate user profiles across all existing UI components
5. **Data Management**: Establish robust user data schemas and validation rules
6. **User Engagement**: Create a foundation for user engagement through profile features and social interactions

## User Stories

### Authentication Stories
- **As a new user**, I want to register with email/password so that I can access the platform
- **As a user**, I want to sign in with Google/Discord so that I can quickly access my account
- **As a user**, I want to sign out securely so that my account remains protected
- **As a user**, I want to reset my password so that I can regain access if I forget it

### Profile Management Stories
- **As a new user**, I want to skip profile setup during registration so that I can explore the platform immediately
- **As a user**, I want to complete my profile later so that I can add my gaming preferences when ready
- **As a user**, I want to upload a profile picture so that other users can identify me
- **As a user**, I want to add my gaming preferences so that I get personalized recommendations
- **As a user**, I want to write a bio so that I can express my gaming personality
- **As a user**, I want to set my privacy preferences so that I control what information is visible

### Social Features Stories
- **As a user**, I want to add friends so that I can see their gaming activity
- **As a user**, I want to follow other users so that I can stay updated on their gaming journey
- **As a user**, I want to view other users' profiles so that I can discover new games and connect

- **Storage**: Use Supabase Storage for profile pictures and media
- **Real-time**: Prepare for future real-time features with Supabase subscriptions
- **Row Level Security**: Implement RLS policies for data protection

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Users table (extends Supabase auth.users)
CREATE TABLE public.profiles (
  id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) PRIMARY KEY,
  username TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  display_name TEXT,
  bio TEXT,
  avatar_url TEXT,
  privacy_level TEXT DEFAULT 'public',
  gaming_preferences JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Social features
CREATE TABLE public.friendships (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES public.profiles(id),
  friend_id UUID REFERENCES public.profiles(id),
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE public.follows (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  follower_id UUID REFERENCES public.profiles(id),
  following_id UUID REFERENCES public.profiles(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(follower_id, following_id)
);
```

### Security Considerations
