### Notes

- The existing `app/api/games/route.ts` needs significant enhancement for proper error handling, caching, and performance optimization
- Current `hooks/use-games.ts` is basic and needs expansion for real-world usage with pagination, filtering, and error states
- Game components need to be created as reusable components to replace hardcoded game arrays in multiple pages
- Database types for `Game` and `UserGame` are already defined in `lib/database/types.ts`

### Database Schema Information

**Existing Tables:**
- `public.profiles` - User profiles (extends auth.users)
- `public.friendships` - Friend relationships 
- `public.follows` - Follow relationships

  - `user_id UUID REFERENCES public.profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`
  - `game_id INTEGER REFERENCES public.games(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`
  - `status TEXT CHECK (status IN ('want_to_play', 'playing', 'completed', 'dropped', 'on_hold'))`
  - `user_rating DECIMAL(2,1) CHECK (user_rating >= 0 AND user_rating <= 5)`
