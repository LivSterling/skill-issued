# Product Requirements Document: RAWG API Integration & Game Data Population

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD outlines the completion of RAWG.io API integration to replace hardcoded game data with real, comprehensive game information from RAWG's database of 500,000+ games. The system will provide users with up-to-date game information, personalized recommendations, and the ability to track their gaming journey with real game data. This integration builds upon the existing foundation of database tables, API services, and UI components already implemented.

## Goals

1. **Data Population**: Replace all hardcoded game arrays with real RAWG.io API data
2. **Performance Optimization**: Implement efficient caching and pagination to stay within API limits
3. **User Experience**: Provide seamless browsing with search, filtering, and personalized recommendations
4. **Data Management**: Establish robust sync strategies for keeping game data current
5. **Scalability**: Build a foundation that can handle growing user base and game library
6. **Cost Efficiency**: Optimize API usage to minimize costs while maintaining functionality
